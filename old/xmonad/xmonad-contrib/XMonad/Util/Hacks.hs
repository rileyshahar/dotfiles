--
-- This module is a collection of random fixes, workarounds and other functions
-- that rely on somewhat hacky implementations which may have unwanted side effects
-- and/or are small enough to not warrant a separate module.
--
-- Import this module as qualified like so:
--
-- > import qualified XMonad.Util.Hacks as Hacks
--
-- and then use the functions you want as described in their respective documentation.

-- $windowedFullscreenFix
-- Windowed fullscreen describes the behaviour in which XMonad,
-- by default, does not automatically put windows that request being fullscreened
-- into actual fullscreen, but keeps them constrained
-- to their normal window dimensions, still rendering them in fullscreen.
--
-- With chromium based applications like Chrome, Discord and others this
-- can cause issues, where the window does not correctly see the size of the window
-- when displaying the fullscreen content, thus cutting off the window content.
--
-- This function works around that issue by forcing the window to recalculate their
-- dimensions after initiating fullscreen, thus making chrome-based applications
-- behave properly when in windowed fullscreen.
--
-- The following gif shows the behaviour of chrome (left) without this fix
-- compared to firefox, which already behaves as expected by default:

--
-- Using this function, chrome will now behave as expected as well:

--
-- Usage:
-- add to handleEventHook as follows:
--
-- > handleEventHook = handleEventHook def <+> Hacks.windowedFullscreenFixEventHook
--

-- | Fixes fullscreen behaviour of chromium based apps by quickly applying and undoing a resize.
-- This causes chromium to recalculate the fullscreen window
-- dimensions to match the actual "windowed fullscreen" dimensions.

-- $java
-- Some java Applications might not work with xmonad. A common workaround would be to set the environment
-- variable @_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING@ to 1. The function 'javaHack' does exactly that.
-- Example usage:
--
-- > main = xmonad $ Hacks.javaHack (def {...})
--

-- | Fixes Java applications that don't work well with xmonad, by setting @_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1@

javaHack conf = conf
  { startupHook = startupHook conf
                    *> io (putEnv "_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1")
  }


-- $raiseTrayer
-- Placing @trayer@ on top of @xmobar@ is somewhat tricky:
--
-- - they both should be lowered to the bottom of the stacking order to avoid
--   overlapping fullscreen windows
--
-- - the tray needs to be stacked on top of the panel regardless of which
--   happens to start first
--
-- 'trayerAboveXmobarEventHook' (and the more generic
-- 'trayAbovePanelEventHook') is an event hook that ensures the latter:
-- whenever the tray lowers itself to the bottom of the stack, it checks
-- whether there are any panels above it and lowers these again.
--
-- To ensure the former, that is having both @trayer@ and @xmobar@ lower
-- themselves, which is a necessary prerequisite for this event hook to
-- trigger:
--
-- - set @lowerOnStart = True@ and @overrideRedirect = True@ in @~/.xmobarrc@
-- - pass @-l@ to @trayer@
--
-- Usage:
--
-- > handleEventHook = â€¦ <> Hacks.trayerAboveXmobarEventHook

-- | Whenever a tray window lowers itself to the bottom of the stack, look for
-- any panels above it and lower these.
