# Development

We have tooling for a modern development workflow provided in an environment
based around `poetry`. If there's another workflow you like better, feel free to
use it, but just make sure you're writing good code, passing tests, and not
introducing additional linter errors. In particular, I will enforce conformance
with `black`.

## Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:nihilistkitten/{{ cookiecutter.name }}.git && cd {{ cookiecutter.name }}`.
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. Install dependencies: `poetry install`.
4. Activate the development environment: `poetry shell`.

I encourage you to set up integration between our dev tools and your editor, but
it's not strictly necessary; you can use them as you please, from their CLIs or
(I suppose) not at all. Regardless, the environment includes
[python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server), which I
personally use for this purpose, and can be used via `lsp-mode` in emacs,
`atom-languageclient` in atom, or the built-in lsp support in neovim and vscode.

## Nox

The tool [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) runs tooling in virtualized
environments. To both run tests and lints, run `nox -r` (`-r` prevents nox from
reinstalling the environments across multiple runs, which saves significant
time.)

## Testing

Testing depends on [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). To run tests, simply run
`pytest` from within the poetry shell. To run tests via nox, run `nox -rs test`.

Code coverage information can be generated by `pytest --cov`. This happens by
default in nox runs.

## Linting

A number of static analysis tools are available in the development environment:

- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), a static type analysis tool.
- [pylint](https://pylint.org/), a general-purpose linter.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), a highly modular linter.
- [flake8-black](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-black), a code formatting
- checker. [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear), which
- makes `flake8` stricter. [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/), a
- documentation linter.

These tend to be quite strict, but after a while you'll get used to them, and
they help write _much_ better code.

To run all lints, run `nox -rs lint`.

## Formatting

We use two tools to enforce a uniform code style:

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black), a highly opinionated code formatter.
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), an import sorter.

To run both formatters, run `nox -rs fmt`. This is _not_ run by default runs of
nox.
